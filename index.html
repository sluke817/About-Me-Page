                <p> 
                    Working for the DSO has provided me with so much useful expierence already. The main "project" for me this summer is to 
                    turn an old Fortran program into a C++ program and provide it as a microservice to the rest of the organization.
                    So far, I have been in a Linux environment attempting to build the original program in a DOS emulator.
                    This project has taken me down so many rabbit holes, and I have learned so much about not only the process of 
                    developing a usable product in the tech space, but I have gained skills in finding a real solution to a tech problem.

                <p>
                    During the summer of 2021 I worked with RAO within DISA. They were a group tasked with providing tech breifings to senior
                    directors. RAO has worked with nearly every part of the Department of Defense at one time or another. I worked on 
                    numerous projects that spanned from revamping the public saftey responses during natural disasters to credential management
                    on government devices. These projects consisted of holding meetings with the stateholders, writing up technical drafts,
                    and creating informaitive presentations. Ultimately, the team would come up with a stance as to how to tackle this project,
                    and then present the review to the senior directors.

                    I currently work with a professor in the Agricultural Engineering department to help him with his hydrology research.
                    This past semester, I built a program that calculates the evapotranspiration over a large data set. The next stages of this
                    work involve creating a web application that reads the output of this data and graphs it for users to visually see the data.
                    I have enjoyed working alongside the researchers and professors and the work they are doing will help farmers, hydrologists, 
                    and hopefully even the State of Missouri itself.

                    In CS 2830, we got an introductory view to web development.
                    Numerous topics were covered, including introductory PHP programming, basic Javascript, 
                    and NodeJS. At the very end of the course, we learned how to integrate Bootstrap into
                    our programs to make them look more professional.

            <h3>Post College Plans</h3>
            <h4>(at least at the moment)</h4>
            <p> 
                After college I hope to be a software engineer. From my expierences, I love to code and I enjoy building programs. 
                The question I always ask myself is where do I see myself working one day. This question is hard to answer, 
                but I would love to work somewhere that the goal of the company isn't to only make a profit. I like the idea of using my skills
                to help a company that isn't necessarily a tech company but does interesting work. For example, I knew a computer science student 
                who went to work for a healthcare company that develops life-saving implants. He helped develop the tech parts of the devices. 
                I believe that something like that would be a good fit for me.
